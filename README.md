This repo has some examples of Python code I've written. Raw data is not included due to confidentiality.

# Example 1: NGER data processing

A [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Sandyxuxinxi/python-energy-data-analysis-showcase/blob/main/nger-data-preprocessor.ipynb) I wrote to streamline data processing for National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting.

# Example 2: Electricity demand forecast

A jupyter notebook I wrote to perform electricity demand forecasting using various ML models (linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, FB Prophet, sktime)

As well as [the notebook](https://github.com/Sandyxuxinxi/python-energy-data-analysis-showcase/blob/main/electricity-demand-forecast.ipynb), I also created a [web based prediction viewer](https://sandyxuxinxi.github.io/python-energy-data-analysis-showcase/prediction-viewer.html)
